    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date]</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot automatically logs user actions within Discord servers where it is present. This includes messages, command usage, and other interactions (“Logged Data”). The Logged Data is primarily stored as Discord messages.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use the Data</h2>
    <p>
      We use Logged Data to provide and maintain the Bot’s features, to moderate or troubleshoot server activities, and to ensure the Bot’s functionality. We do not sell or rent Logged Data to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Logged Data is stored in Discord’s infrastructure, and its retention depends on Discord’s policies and the settings of each server. We do not store or transfer Logged Data to external databases unless explicitly stated.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share Logged Data with third parties, except:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>When required by law or valid legal process.</li>
      <li>To protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Data processed by Discord is subject to Discord’s own Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      While we strive to secure the Bot’s access, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We are not responsible for breaches arising from Discord’s platform or misconfigurations beyond our control.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot is intended for general audiences and is not directed at children under the age required by Discord (usually 13). If you become aware that a minor is using the Bot in violation of local laws, please contact us immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the Bot after the changes become effective indicates your acceptance of the updated Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
      For questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [Contact Info].
