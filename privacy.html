    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date]</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot automatically logs user actions within Discord servers where it is present. This includes messages, command usage, and other interactions (“Logged Data”). The Logged Data is primarily stored as Discord messages (e.g., in server channels or direct messages).
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use the Data</h2>
    <p>
      We use Logged Data to provide and maintain the Bot’s features, to moderate or troubleshoot server activities, and to ensure the Bot’s functionality. We do not sell or rent Logged Data to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Since Logged Data is stored in Discord’s infrastructure, the retention period depends on Discord’s own policies and the settings of each server. We do not store or transfer Logged Data to external databases unless explicitly stated here. If we ever choose to do so, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share Logged Data with third parties, except:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When required by law or valid legal process (e.g., subpoena).</li>
      <li>To protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We rely on Discord as a platform; any data processed by Discord is subject to Discord’s own Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We strive to keep the Bot’s access secure, but no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We are not responsible for breaches arising from Discord’s platform or server misconfigurations beyond our control.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot is intended for general audiences and is not directed at children under the age required by Discord (usually 13). If you become aware that a minor has used the Bot in violation of local laws or Discord’s Terms, please contact us immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will post the revised policy and update the “Last Updated” date above. Continued use of the Bot after the changes become effective indicates your acceptance of the updated Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
      For questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [Contact Info].
