    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date]</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By inviting or using the [Bot Name] (“the Bot”) in your Discord server, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Bot.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Bot Functionality and Logging</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot logs all actions performed in any server where it is installed, including user messages and interactions. Logged data remains in Discord’s infrastructure and is not separately stored on external servers unless otherwise stated in our Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to use the Bot in compliance with all applicable laws, Discord’s Terms of Service, and any server-specific rules. You must not use the Bot for illegal or unauthorized purposes, including harassment, spam, or any activity that violates intellectual property rights.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot’s underlying code, branding, and content are the property of [Your Name/Entity]. Users may not reverse engineer, modify, or distribute the Bot’s code without explicit written permission.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot is provided “as is” and “as available.” We make no warranties or representations about its reliability, uptime, or accuracy, and we are not liable for any losses or damages arising from its use.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to remove or block the Bot from any server, or to terminate these Terms at any time, for any reason. Users may remove the Bot from their server at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms of Service at our discretion. Continued use of the Bot after changes become effective indicates your acceptance of the new Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us at [Contact Info].
